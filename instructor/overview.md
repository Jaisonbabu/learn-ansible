# Introduction

The workshop opens by having everyone `npm install -g bocoup/learn-ansible`.
The instructor's terminal should be visible to the workshop as he or she demos
how to use the tool. Each time an exercise is selected, some files will be
copied to the current directory under a folder matching the exercise name.

Each exercise contains a detailed exploration of the concept being introduced,
as well as sample configuration files and solutions where applicable.

The instructor will begin each section by using the overview file as a guide to
explain the new concept. After fielding any questions, attendees will then run
`learn-ansible` on their own machine to begin development.
