# Introduction

The workshop opens by having everyone `npm install -g bocoup/learn-ansible`.
The instructor's terminal should be visible to the workshop as he or she demos
how to use the tool. Each time an exercise is selected, some files will be
copied to the current directory under a folder matching the exercise name.

Each exercise contains a detailed exploration of the concept being introduced,
as well as sample configuration files and solutions where applicable. For most
of the exercises in this class, attendees will need to destroy their Vagrant
machine and bring up a new one in the next exercise.

The instructor will begin each section by using this overview file as a guide
to explain the new concept. After fielding any questions, attendees will begin
development on their own machine.
